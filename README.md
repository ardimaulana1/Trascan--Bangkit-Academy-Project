# Trascan--Bangkit-Academy-Project

Trascan is an innovative project that aims to help users easily distinguish between organic and inorganic waste
through direct scanning technology. This application uses the camera on mobile devices to scan the waste to
be disposed of. After scanning, the application will determine whether the type of waste belongs to the
organic or inorganic category

Building a multi-class classification model to classify garbage image dataset that consists of 6 classes, 
but only 5 classes used here namely cardboard, glass, metal, paper, and plastic. 
implement CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) architecture for creating our model using TensorFlow and Keras library. 
also use a technique namely Data Augmentation to get better accuracy. As a result, 
create a sequential model with four convolutional layers and four pooling layers, a flatten layer, a fully-connected dense layer and a final dense layer with 5 neurons.
As for now the accuracy is 80%. Later, save the model as .h5 TensorFlow model and use Cloud Function to deploy the Machine Learning model.
